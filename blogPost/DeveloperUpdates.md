# Developer Updates on Meowcoin

As the Meowcoin project continues to grow and evolve, we're excited to share some significant developer updates that promise to enhance the functionality, security, and user experience of Meowcoin. Our team has been working tirelessly behind the scenes, and we're thrilled to bring you closer to the innovations shaping the future of Meowcoin.

### Anticipating Komodo Integration

One of the most eagerly awaited developments is the integration with Komodo. This monumental step forward will unlock a plethora of new features for Meowcoin. Decentralized DEX for instant coin swaps, alongside functional iOS and Android wallets designed to streamline your digital currency experience. While we're aware of reports concerning Android device compatibility issues, rest assured, we're on it and will provide updates as we smooth out these wrinkles.

### Electrum Wallet Client: A User-Friendly Marvel

Thanks again to Craig from [CoinMinerz](https://coinminerz.com/`), who has dedicated countless hours to developing a user-friendly and highly functional Electrum wallet client for Meowcoin. Electrum has speed, minimal resource usage, and a simplified approach to managing your digital assets. With Electrum, your wallet is recoverable through a secret phrase you can either commit to memory or jot down on paper. Near-instant startup times thanks to servers handling the heavy lifting.

### PawPrint: Blockchain, for Animals

We're also making strides with PawPrint. With some front-end work already complete, we're diving into the development of authentication features and databases that promise security and ease of use. It's a journey toward a major milestone, and with every step, we move closer to our end goal.

### MeowPow: Powering Through

The MeowPow fork has proven to be a tremendous success, further solidifying our community's enthusiasm and support for Meowcoin. With three different mining options available for Meowcoin enthusiasts and ongoing efforts to attract more miners to support MeowPow, the future looks bright. Our community's active engagement in reaching out to developers is a testament to the collaborative spirit that drives Meowcoin.

### The Upcoming DAG Change

A significant update is on the horizon with the upcoming DAG change. Currently, at block 814,519(at time of writing), the change is slated for epoch 110, or block 825,000, introducing a DAG over 4GB. This change may impact the hashrate.

### Empawrium: Addressing Challenges

Our journey with Empawrium, the NFT marketplace within the Meowcoin ecosystem, has been a challenging one. The complexity and nuances of Empawrium's vast codebase has necessitated changes across various components.

We're fully aware of the frustrations and inconveniences our community has faced with Empawrium. Our team is committed to addressing these issues, though we're mindful of the balance required to manage ongoing projects simultaneously. Improvements are being made, but the path forward involves some careful navigation through Empawrium's code.

Our hope is to enhance Empawrium's reliability and user experience in a timely manner, recognizing the importance of transparency and patience throughout this process. We value the support and understanding as we work to resolve these issues and improve the platform for everyone involved.

As we continue to move forward, these updates mark critical milestones in our journey. We're dedicated to transparency and innovation, ensuring that Meowcoin not only meets but exceeds the expectations of our community. Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, thank you for your unwavering support and enthusiasm for Meowcoin.
