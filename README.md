# MeowPow Integration

## MeowPow

MeowPow is a novel proof-of-work algorithm derived from ProgPow. It introduces several parameter changes aimed at achieving lower power consumption while maintaining the robust reliability and functionality of ProgPow.

### MeowPow Parameters

- Period Length: 6
- Number of Registers: 16
- Number of Lanes: 16
- Number of Cache Accesses: 6
- Number of Math Operations: 9
- L1 Cache Size: 16 KB
- L1 Cache Number of Items: Calculated based on L1 cache size

### Background

MeowPow represents the culmination of over four testnet iterations. Its development involved extensive collaboration and testing to optimize its parameters for efficiency and reliability.
